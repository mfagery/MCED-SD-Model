Vensim MCED SD Model Usage Guide

•	The model begins by identifying the population eligible for cancer screening, represented by the green boxes.
•	For individuals undergoing standard of care (SOC) screening, the model follows the pathway depicted on the right side, applicable to all cancer types.
•	For individuals undergoing MCED testing, the pathway on the left side of the model is followed, which is also applicable to all cancer types.
•	Under the "Select view" option, the model provides five different views of the SD model:
o	Model Structure: Displays the entire model including clinical pathways for all cancer types, with the option to add equations that simulate patient outcomes.
o	Cancer Stage Results: Shows the total number of patients diagnosed at each cancer stage, aggregating results from both SOC and MCED screenings.
o	Cost Results: Presents the total costs from screening through to cancer diagnosis, with the ability to display costs for each cancer type separately.
o	Health Outcomes Results: Provides the five-year overall survival (OS) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained for all patients across all cancer types.
o	Cost per QALY: Estimates the cost per QALY by combining all costs and QALYs and calculating the cost per QALY ratio.
